As security in the country improves, tourism increases; in two years, it has increased by more than 300%.\nIn 2018, the British Backpacker Society ranked Pakistan the world\'s top adventure travel destination, describing the country as ""one of the friendliest countries on earth, with mountain scenery that is beyond anyone\'s wildest imagination"".
